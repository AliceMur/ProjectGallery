# Predicting Fraudulent Transactions

### Accuracy ~99.86% on test set

This project involved developing a deep neural network model that detects fraudulent transactions by training it on a mock dataset of bank records. I built the model using Tensorflow and pandas. I also used ADAM as the model optimizer and categorical cross-entropy as the loss function. The resulting model consists of six neural network layers with 755,252 Trainable Parameters. 

To visualize the data and the model training results, I used the matplotlib and seaborn libraries. The resulting scatterplots, bar charts, confusion matrix, and pie chart can be seen in the Graphs folder.
