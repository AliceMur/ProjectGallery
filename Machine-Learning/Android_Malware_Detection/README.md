# Android Malware Detection

### Accuracy ~98.88% on test set

This project involved developing a deep neural network model to detect potential malware by training it on a TUNADROMD dataset, which contains 4465 instances and 241 attributes. I built the model using Keras and pandas. I also used ADAM as the model optimizer and binary cross-entropy as the loss function. The resulting model consists of four neural network layers with 23,577 Trainable Parameters. 

To visualize the data and the model training results, I used the matplotlib libraries. The resulting line chart can be seen in the Graphs folder.
