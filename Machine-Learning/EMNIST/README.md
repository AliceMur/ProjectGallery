# Machine Learning Predictions of handwritten alphabet letters using the EMNIST database

### Accuracy ~90% on test set

This project trains an image processing model on the EMNIST database and classifies handwritten letters from the English alphabet. I used ADAM as the model optimizer and categorical crossentropy as the loss function. The resulting model, which I made with Tensorflow, consists of three neural network layers with 120,475 Trainable Parameters.
