# Predicting Brain Tumors

### Accuracy ~97.75% on test set

This project involved developing a deep neural network model that detects potential brain tumors by training it on an MRI image dataset. I built the model using Tensorflow and pandas. I also used ADAM as the model optimizer and categorical cross-entropy as the loss function. The resulting model consists of 58,986,178 Trainable Parameters. 

To visualize the model training results, I used the matplotlib and seaborn libraries. The resulting plot graph can be seen in the Graphs folder.
