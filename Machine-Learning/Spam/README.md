# Differentiating between spam vs. not spam

### Accuracy ~99.33% on test set

This project involved developing a deep neural network model that detects spam by training it on a mock dataset of emails. I built the model using Keras and pandas. I also used RMSPROP as the model optimizer and binary cross-entropy as the loss function. The resulting model consists of four neural network layers with 4,328,103 Trainable Parameters. 

To visualize the data and the model training results, I used the matplotlib and seaborn libraries. The resulting bar charts, line chart, and confusion matrix can be seen in the Graphs folder.
