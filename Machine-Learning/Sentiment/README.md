# Predicting Sentiment in IMDB reviews

### Accuracy ~83.73% on test set

This project involved developing a deep neural network model for assessing the overall sentiment of a given IMDB review (ie. whether the review was a positive or negative one). I did this by training the model with a dataset of IMDB reviews. I built the model using Keras and pandas. I also used ADAM as the model optimizer and binary cross-entropy as the loss function. The resulting model consists of four neural network layers with 162,863 Trainable Parameters. 

To visualize the data and the model training results, I used the matplotlib and seaborn libraries. The resulting line chart can be seen in the Graphs folder.
